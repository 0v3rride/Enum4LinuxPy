# Enum4LinuxPy
Everyone's favorite SMB/SAMBA/CIFS enumeration tool rewritten in everyone's favorite language.

## Why
The original Perl version has a number of outstanding issues that have been open for over a year and have not been addressed. This results in mangled output, errors, etc.

## Progress
All of the the functions (except a couple of redudant ones) found in the original version have been ported over. I'll try to add some additional functionality as time permits to enhance it a little.

### **Credit for the original Perl version of Enum4Linux goes to Mark Lowe and Portcullis Labs.**
