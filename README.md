# Enum4LinuxPy
Everyone's favorite SMB/SAMBA/CIFS enumeration tool rewritten in python.

## Why
The original Perl version has a number of outstanding issues that have been open for over a year and have not been addressed. This results in mangled output, errors, etc.

## Progress/Todo
* N/A

### **Credit for the original Perl version of Enum4Linux goes to Mark Lowe and Portcullis Labs.**
